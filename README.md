## 3. Problem Statement
In modern households, a significant amount of electricity is wasted due to appliances being left on unnecessarily. Traditional smart home systems allow remote control, but they often lack advanced automation and AI-driven optimization to reduce wastage effectively.  
Rising electricity bills and increasing environmental concerns demand a smarter, automated, and more user-friendly approach to energy management.

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
The **Voice-Controlled Smart Home Energy Saver** is an IoT-based system designed to monitor and manage household energy usage efficiently.  
The system will:  
- Continuously track the power consumption of connected appliances.  
- Provide AI-powered recommendations to optimize energy usage.  
- Allow users to control appliances via **voice commands** (Google Assistant/Alexa).  
- Automatically switch off idle devices to prevent wastage.  
- Generate monthly reports showing cost savings and environmental impact.
